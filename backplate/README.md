# Backplate

The backplate is the wall-mounted base that connects to the signal lines from HVAC system(s). It is responsible for :
 - **charging** the main display's battery 
 - **controlling** furnaces and air conditioning, and **detecting faults** with HVAC equipment
 - **sensing** proximity of a person (for waking up the display) and ambient light (for brightness) (for some reason, the controller on the backplate connects to these sensors)
